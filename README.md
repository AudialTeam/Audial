Music Exploration/Bridging Application

This Project began as a concept on the drive to Music Hacks 2014 in Boston and wasn't brought to fruition until my web design class following my return to Rochester. It is a tool intended to be gamified collection of Music and Sound Effects from free resources. It is currently under Development. Right now it has a music and sound effects lookup in three databases. Soon it will have user accounts, playlisting, and point-based gamification with details to be added here later.
